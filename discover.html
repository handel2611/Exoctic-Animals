                        <h2>Serval Cat</h2>
                        <p>
                            Native to Africa, this cat has the longest legs 
                            relative to its body size, which helps it achieve 
                            top speeds of up to 50 mph. Like the Fennec Fox,  
                            its large ears provide it with acute 
                            hearing abilities.

                        <h2>Fennec Fox</h2>
                        <p>
                            These foxes are typically found in Northern Africa 
                            and Saharan locations. Their large ears, which are 
                            likely the first thing most people notice, help them 
                            stay cool.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            They travel in packs, unlike most other foxes, and 
                            are also Algeria’s national animal.

                        <h2>Sugar Glider</h2>
                        <p>
                            The name isn’t far off from what these animals are 
                            like in life—sugary foods are their preferred diet, 
                            and they have the ability to glide through the air, 
                            much like a flying squirrel.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For them, gliding is not only a means of movement, 
                            but also a way to find food and evade predators. 
                            They are mainly found in parts of Australia, New 
                            Guinea, and Tasmania.

                        <h2>Pangolin</h2>
                        <p>
                            Pangolin comes from the Latin word “pengguling,” 
                            which translates to “something that rolls up”—certainly 
                            true of this animal. The Pangolin can be found in tropical 
                            regions of Africa and Asia, and its scaled body is a 
                            distinct characteristic.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            They emit a smell very similar to a skunk, and they 
                            possess extremely long tongues that extend all the 
                            way into their abdominal cavity.

                        <h2>Patagonian Mara</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Patagonian Mara resembles a rabbit, and is technically 
                            a part of the rodent family. They can be found in Argentina 
                            and live in a very particular mode of monogamy, though they 
                            sometimes breed in groups of up to 29 pairs.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Margay Cat</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Margay Cat lives throughout South America and 
                            Mexico and is related to Ocelots, which offer a striking 
                            resemblance—sometimes known as “tree ocelots” because of 
                            their excellent climbing abilities.
                            <br>
                            These cats spend most of their time in trees, instead of 
                            on the ground, and can jump up to 12 feet into the air. 
                            They’re also primarily nocturnal animals.
